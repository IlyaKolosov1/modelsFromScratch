# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms **from scratch** for educational purposes.  
The first model is **Linear Regression**. The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematics and mechanics behind the algorithms.

---

## ðŸ§® Linear Regression

Implementation of linear regression with the following methods:
1. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** via the normal equation.
2. **Gradient Descent**
3. Metrics: MSE
